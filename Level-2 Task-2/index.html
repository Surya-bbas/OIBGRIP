          <p>&emsp;&emsp;Hitler affected the world as a whole and was a main cause of WWII. He murdered millions of Jews and countless soldiers in his plan to control Europe. He almost did it, too. Below is a list of major events in Hitler's personal life.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>April 20, 1889: Hitler is born to Alois and Klara Schicklgruber -- child #5.</li>

            <li>1892: The Hitler family moves from Braunau Am Inn, Austria to an area near Linz, Austria.</li>
            <li>1894: Edmund is born-- Adolf's second brother.</li>

            </li>

            <li>1900: Edmund dies.</li>
            <p class="note">Adolf becomes "detatched and introverted" and at this time he "... showed an early interest in German nationalism, rejecting the authority of Austria-Hungary. This nationalism would become the motivating force of Hitler's life" (historyplace.com)</p>
            <li>1903: Alois dies.</li>
            <li>1905: Adolf develops lung problems and drops out of school.</li>

            <li>1924: Hitler begins writing <em>Mein Kamph,</em> in which he describes his political ideas- one of which is the Holocaust. Another is his main plan for world domination: "The Germans would first fight in the south and move in to Czechoslovakia. They would then go back across Germany to fight France and Britain. When they won, the German army would again move across Germany to fight the Russians; and finally, they would defeat the United States" (Eric Graham).</li>

              <ul>
                <li>The Nazi party gets less than five percent of votes in a German election.</li>
